# The SGXP: The Open Source Sprite Website

## Introduction
The SGXP has evolved quite a bit since I first started the project in the summer of 2019. From a small webpage hardcoded in HTML with a small bit of CSS, to a fully functional site based in PHP, this site has grown at the same speed as my knowledge in web development. Along the way we have also amassed a small community of members pasionate about the medium of spriting; and though we started as an MFZ clone, we have managed to spread our wings and become something all on our own.

Though what we have currently fits our needs fine, underneath the hood the site's architecture lacks some of the basic functionality that can now be found in free WordPress websites. With the exception of the forum and news feed, everything that you see is updated by hardcoding each line of HTML individually, with repeated elements stored in php snippets. This is an incredibly oldschool way to run a website, not to mention labor intensive. It has been painfully obvious that we need some tools to make running this place easy and efficient.

That is where this project comes in. 

The current repository you are looking at is the React.js version of our website, with backend code handled by node.js. The current plan is to restructure the css to be more mobile friendly, convert the old code to function in react, then start building new tools that will serve as the backbone for running the site. 

At present my programming knowledge is mediocre at best, which means that things will probably go at a snails pace until I can obtain a baseline knowledge good enough to build things more quickly. Until then this repository will be updated periodically, with a running task list in place to plan out the different components I would like to complete before deploying the beta version of the application. By the end, I would like to have a user friendly application, complete with an admin panel, user profiles, uploading tools, page galleries and other things. 

If you are a programmer and feel like you could be useful to this project, I encourage you to DM me over on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/196978916123082752) or visit the SGXP [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YBXbDSHm9f) and hit me up.

## Getting Started

Linked [here](https://github.com/Xypter/SGXP/issues/1) is a running list of all the things I would like to implement into this application. If you think there is something that should be added, I suggest adding a comment below it so I can add it in.
